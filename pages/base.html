              <h1>Welcome to <b>No Worries Woodworking</b></h1>

              <p>

                This is where I will host my Woodworking projects.

              </p>

              <p>

                This will also be a learning experience for me. I'm going to learn how
                to use AngularJS to create a much more responsive website while
                incorporating this javascript heavy framework. I'm not sure how to tackle
                the users/email/comments part. I have written start up sites for people
                in specific languages with specific frameworks; python, flask, and
                django. This site is strictly front-end work though; I don't believe
                github allows users to tinker with back-end much, but I will find out. If
                I am allowed to run a back-end server on github, I will be exploring
                how capable Java and Spring are.
