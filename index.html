    <h1>Welcome to <b>No Worries Woodworking</b></h1>

    <p>

      This is where I will host my Woodworking projects.

    <p>

      This will also be a learning experience for me. I'm going to learn how
      to use AngularJS to create a much more responsive website while
      incorporating this javascript heavy framework. I'm not sure how to tackle
      the users/email/comments part. I have written start up sites for people
      in specific languages with specific frameworks; python, flask, and
      django. This site is strictly front-end work though; I don't believe
      github allows users to tinker with back-end much, but I will find out. If
      I am allowed to run a back-end server on github, I will be exploring
      how capable Java and Spring are.
